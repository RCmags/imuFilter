sentence=Sensor fusion for an IMU to obtain heading and velocity.
paragraph=Library to fuse the data of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and estimate velocity. It uses a quaternion to encode the rotation and uses a kalman-like filter to correct the gyroscope with the accelerometer. The acceleration is integrated via a kalman-like filter to obtain a short-term estimate of the velocity.
